# Summary

This tool was based on Kaadesign's Lens wench, Thing: 1557754

My design is suited for the Raspberry Pi Camera V2.1 and if you print two of them, you will have a 8mm socket to hold the lens base and the other end to adjust the lens.

This new version has a gap under the square end to accommodate the 7mm ribbon cable coming out of the 8mm square base.

I found that I could use the socket wench to adjust a V1.3 camera lens.

# Print Settings

Printer: Felix 3.1
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: .1
Infill: 50%+

Notes: 
Sliced using Simplify3D and took around 8 minutes to print. The Felix printer printed this out in fine detail and the tool worked straight off.

I used a 4 ring brim on the virtually printed socket lens wrench.  This tool allowed me to adjust a lens I had previously placed in a waterproof case.

# How I Designed This

I used Thing:1557754  STL file as a template, and redrew the tool in Design Spark Mechanical V2.
